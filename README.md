the source code contained in this directory allows to compile the SPARROW software
for protein secondary structure prediction. SPARROW predicts protein secondary structure
based on a position specific scoring matrix (PSI-BLAST profile).
if PSI-BLAST is installed in your system, it's possible to perform predictions based on
a sequence of amino acids (in FASTA format).
